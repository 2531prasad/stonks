# **App Name**: CodeFlow Terminal

## Core Features:

- Terminal Emulator: Display a command-line interface (CLI) in a web browser.
- Command Execution: Allow users to execute common terminal commands.
- Session Persistence: Persist user's session state (command history and current directory) to local storage.

- Environment Management: Offer pre-configured environments (e.g., Python, Node.js) to facilitate development workflows.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of focus and technical expertise.
- Background color: Dark Gray (#282C34) to reduce eye strain and provide contrast.
- Accent color: Electric Green (#00FF00) for prompts, input, and important output.
- Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for clear code and command readability.
- Clean and minimal layout with clear separation of input and output sections.
- Subtle animations for command execution and AI assistance to provide visual feedback.
