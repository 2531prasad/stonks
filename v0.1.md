# Dev Log: v0.1

This log tracks the initial development sprint, focusing on core UI enhancements, bug squashing, and the creation of the first utility application.

## ‚ú® Features & Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced UI & Visual Depth
- **Ambient Background:** Introduced a `BackgroundBlobs` component to create a dynamic, layered background, adding a sense of depth to the interface.
- **Improved Window Aesthetics:** Windows now have a translucent, "glassmorphism" effect with refined borders and deeper shadows, making them feel more tangible.
- **Choreographed Motion:** Window opening is now animated with a subtle fade and zoom, making the experience feel more polished and less jarring.
- **Tuned Ambient Effects:** The frequency of shooting stars was reduced to make them a delightful, occasional surprise rather than a constant distraction.

### 2. New 'Calculator' Application
- **Minimalist Design:** Created a sleek, "chrome-less" calculator app based on a visual design reference. It features no title bar and a close button that appears only on hover.
- **Draggable & Resizable:** The calculator is a fully integrated floating window within the desktop environment.
- **Functional UI:** Includes a display area for results, a keyboard input for expressions, and an "All Clear" (AC) button for easy resets.
- **Quick Access:** The calculator can be easily launched via the command palette (‚åòK).

## üêõ Bug Fixes & Refinements

- **Performance:** Diagnosed and resolved significant UI lag that occurred when dragging windows. The root cause was correctly identified as an animation class conflict, not a `backdrop-blur` issue.
- **Window Positioning:** Corrected the logic for positioning new windows to ensure they open centered within the main content area, not the entire viewport.
- **Conditional Window Styles:** Refactored the window rendering logic to support different styles per application. This fixed an issue where the calculator's unique chrome-less design was incorrectly applied to the terminal.
- **Reference Errors:** Squashed multiple `ReferenceError` crashes in the `Explorer` component caused by variable name typos.
- **Module Not Found:** Fixed a build error by correcting an invalid import path for a hook used in the calculator component.
